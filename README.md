# Electric-Power-Hourly-Hybrid-Load-Forecasting-using-Recurrent-Neural-Networks

This project implements a novel hybrid neural network architecture combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) for hourly electricity load forecasting in Toronto. The hybrid approach addresses the limitations of traditional RNN/LSTM models in capturing sharp peak variations while maintaining excellent trend prediction capabilities.
