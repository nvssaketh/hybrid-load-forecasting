# A Comparative Study of Hybrid RNN-SNN and DRNN-SNN Models for Electric Load Forecasting

This repository chronicles a project on high-accuracy electricity load forecasting by developing and comparing two distinct hybrid neural network architectures: a baseline RNN+SNN model and an enhanced DRNN+SNN model. The initial RNN+SNN hybrid combines a standard Recurrent Neural Network, effective for general sequence modeling, with a bio-inspired Spiking Neural Network (SNN) that processes temporal data through event-driven spikes. The subsequent, more advanced DRNN+SNN model substitutes the standard RNN with a Dilated RNN (DRNN), specifically chosen for its superior ability to capture long-range dependencies and multi-scale patterns within the time-series data. By methodically evaluating both hybrid systems, this project demonstrates a clear performance improvement, showcasing how architectural enhancements from RNN to DRNN within a hybrid framework can lead to a more robust and accurate forecasting solution.
