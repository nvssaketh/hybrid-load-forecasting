HYBRID RNN-SNN ELECTRICITY LOAD FORECASTING
Achieving Research-Grade Accuracy with a Neuromorphic Approach

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:

- RNN (LSTM) Component: Implemented using TensorFlow/Keras with stacked Long Short-Term Memory layers to effectively capture temporal dependencies and predict the overall load trend.
- Real SNN Component: Implemented using snnTorch with genuine Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) spiking neurons. This component is specifically designed for high-precision peak and valley detection, leveraging biologically-inspired, event-driven processing.
- Hybrid Integration: An intelligent fusion of the RNN and SNN predictions, creating a single, robust forecast that combines the trend-following capability of the RNN with the peak-detection strength of the SNN.

DATA PROCESSING:

- Dataset: Toronto Hydro 2016 hourly electricity consumption data.
- Preprocessing: Advanced time-series preprocessing to ensure data quality and model stability.
- Sequence length: 24 hours (a full day) of historical data used to predict the next hour's load.
- Train/test split: 80%/20% chronological split to ensure a robust evaluation on unseen data.
- Data normalization: MinMaxScaler used to scale data between 0 and 1, which is optimal for both RNN and SNN models and a significant improvement over previous methods.

MODEL PERFORMANCE:
The new architecture resulted in a dramatic improvement in forecasting accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art performance competitive with published research.

| Model            | MSE              | MAE          | MAPE (%) |
|------------------|------------------|--------------|----------|
| RNN (LSTM)       | 8,452,292,035.49 | 73,816.63    | 3.72%    |
| Real SNN         | 3,268,160,416.81 | 44,257.11    | 2.69%    |
| Hybrid RNN-SNN   | 4,677,676,197.95 | 53,998.04    | 2.92%    |

Conclusion: The standalone Real SNN proved to be the most accurate individual model, achieving an exceptional 2.69% MAPE. The Hybrid RNN-SNN also delivered outstanding, research-grade performance at 2.92% MAPE, successfully solving the peak-smoothing problem and demonstrating the power of a neuromorphic approach to time-series forecasting.
